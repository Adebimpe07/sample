     <h1>Technology update andg development </h1>
     <p>We start our web design process with a conversation to identify your business goals and objectives for your website and to truly get to know you and your business brand needs better. Together we draft a timeline and project plan ideal to deliver an innovative web design enriched in future-forward technology.
To honor our partnership of tailored strategy and design, we conduct extensive research on our end of your industry, competitors, audience, and even interviews with internal stakeholders to ensure the design is successful for your business.
Once the research is complete, we lay the plan's foundation by creating a sitemap and wireframe 
mapping out key features, functionalities, and structure of your new website. With your approval, 
this step ensures our joint effort throughout the project and guides our team through completing your design.</p>
